Homebrew is a non-profit project run entirely by unpaid volunteers.

_**all** information requested_. If you repeatedly fail to fill out the issue template,
you will be blocked from ever submitting issues to Homebrew.

We will review your suggestion and let you know our decision as soon as we can.
Note, that:

- proposed features must be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users.
