# Contributing to Homebrew
First time contributing to Homebrew? Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/CODEOFCONDUCT.md#code-of-conduct).


### Looking for a way to contribute?

The Homebrew maintainers keep a grab-bag list of improvements we think would be interesting on Trello [link to Trello board]. There's a mix of big and small projects. If you're interested in working on one of these projects, let us know and we'll be happy to give feedback! Opening a GitHub issue, sending an email to our discussion list, or finding us on Freenode in #machomebrew are great ways to get in touch.

Please get in touch sooner rather than later; after thinking about an idea a little longer, we may decide it has consequences we don't like, and we definitely don't want to waste your time.


### Report a bug

* run `brew update` (twice)
* run and read `brew doctor`
* read [the Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting)
* open an issue on the formula's repository

Thanks!
