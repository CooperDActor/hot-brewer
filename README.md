codezilla ðŸ¦– One giant collection of algorithms & design patterns.

The pandora box of algorithms and data structures

Feel free to contribute. Create an issue, let others know which algorithm/data structure you are planning to add. Fork the repo. And make a PR!

The goal is to create a codebase for developers to access. Later we aim to develop extensions using this codebase to support multiple IDEs.

How To Contribute to This Project
Here are 3 quick and painless steps to contribute to this project:

Star this repository to show your support for Asiatik

Add a a program to implement an algorithm in any language. To do so, first create an issue with the task you are doing, for example: "Issue - creating bubble sort in C". Create a pull request in response to that issue and finally submit it for review.

Name your branch Like #23 Add Bubble Sort in C.

Also create a directory for any new algorithm if it doesn't exist. eg. observable_pattern, bubble_sort. Inside these directories you can create a folder for the programming language you want to add. And finally add your own file named program_name.language_extension (bubble_sort.cpp) Create a commit of the form - fixes #(issue_number)

Make sure you adhere to the algorithm/language/file folder structure while adding code.

Easiest way (Recommended) star -You can run bash runme.bh on your terminal to make the appropriate file structure

Additionally we recommend using standard convention for your language such as indentation and variable naming while writing the algorithm. Useful comments will be a help. Finally, if you can write tests for you code, we urge you to do so.

Finally, wait for it to be merged!
Getting Started
Fork this repository (Click the Fork button in the top right of this page, click your Profile Image)

Clone your fork down to your local machine

in the above example Anujg935 is the username of the user who is forking the repository.

Create a branch

$ git checkout -b branch-name
Make your changes

Commit and Push

$ git add filename 
$ git commit -m 'commit message'
$ git push origin branch-name
Create a New Pull Request from your forked repository (Click the New Pull Request button located at the top of your repo)

Wait for your PR review and merge approval!

Star this repository to show your support for Asiatik

Don't forget to include the comments as seen above. Feel free to include additional information about the language you chose in your comments too! Like a link to a helpful introduction or tutorial.

# Homebrew
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Homebrew/brew.svg)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases)

Features, usage and installation instructions are [summarised on the homepage](https://brew.sh). Terminology (e.g. the difference between a Cellar, Tap, Cask and so forth) is [explained here](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#homebrew-terminology).

## What Packages Are Available?
1. Type `brew search` for a list.
2. Or visit [formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh) to browse packages online.
3. Or use `brew search --desc <keyword>` to browse packages from the command line.

## More Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [our documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/).

## Troubleshooting
First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting).

**If you don't read these it will take us far longer to help you with your problem.**

We'd love you to contribute to Homebrew. First, please read our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#code-of-conduct).

We explicitly welcome contributions from people who have never contributed to open-source before: we were all beginners once! We can help build on a partially working pull request with the aim of getting it merged. We are also actively seeking to diversify our contributors and especially welcome contributions from women from all backgrounds and people of colour.

A good starting point for contributing is running `brew audit --strict` with some of the packages you use (e.g. `brew audit --strict wget` if you use `wget`) and then read through the warnings, try to fix them until `brew audit --strict` shows no results and [submit a pull request](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request). If no formulae you use have warnings you can run `brew audit --strict` without arguments to have it run on all packages and pick one.

Alternatively, for something more substantial, check out one of the issues labeled `help wanted` in [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

Good luck!
