To that I'd like to add, my modifications to homebrew will wreck your
life. Do not use them they are the coding's of a madman with no regard
for safety. Seriously, Most of the changes I've made to brew have been
to remove safety and sanity checks from brew's build process. The
homebrew community has done an amazing job creating this package manager
which will build reliably on any modern mac. I've done my best to remove
the amazement and make a version of homebrew which will sometimes but
not always work on my laptop. It is targeted solely at my laptop and no
other device. As I said earlier it only occasionally works on my laptop.
It will introduce bugs in your system that are hard to track.
